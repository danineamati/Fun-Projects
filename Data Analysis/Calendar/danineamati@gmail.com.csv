Are you writing a research paper or ready to start your thesis? Looking for an easy way to store, manage and search for bibliographic references? Introduction to Zotero may be just the quick-start session you need. Zotero is an open-source community-developed bibliographic citation manager that has similar capability to EndNote. Demonstrations will include importing citations into Zotero from academic sources, preparing bibliographies, using word processor integration, cloud sharing functionality, and other topics as audience interest dictates (and as time allows).
